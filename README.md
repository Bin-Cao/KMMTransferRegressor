## Transfer learning links
1 : Instance-based transfer learning
  - Instance selection (marginal distributions are same while conditional distributions are different) :

  - Instance re-weighting (conditional distributions are same while marginal distributions are different) :

2 : Feature-based transfer learning
  - Explicit distance:
      - case 1 : marginal distributions are same while conditional distributions are different:

      - case 1 : conditional distributions are same while marginal distributions are different
      
        JDA
      
      - case 3 : Both marginal distributions and conditional distributions are different
      
        DDA
      
 - Implicit distance :
 
   DANN

 3 : Parameter-based transfer learning
 
 - Pretraining + fine tune
